# Git Staging Issues with Special Characters in Paths (Zsh)

## Problem Description

When attempting to stage files for commit using `git add`, the command fails with a `zsh: no matches found:` error if the file path contains special characters such as parentheses `()` or square brackets `[]`.

**Observed Error:**

```bash
*[main][~/projects/next-projexts/simple-app]$ git add app/(nona)/print/invoice/[invoiceId]/page.tsx
zsh: no matches found: app/(nona)/print/invoice/[invoiceId]/page.tsx
```

The `git status` command correctly shows the files as "new file", indicating Git is aware of their existence but the `add` command is not receiving the correct file path due to the shell's interpretation.

## Root Cause

The issue is not with Git itself, but how the Zsh shell (or other shells with similar behavior) interprets command-line arguments before passing them to the command (`git add` in this case).

Characters like `(`, `)`, `[`, and `]` are treated as special characters for shell globbing (pattern matching). When these characters appear unquoted in a command-line argument, the shell attempts to expand them as patterns matching files or directories. If no literal match is found for the pattern (because the characters are part of the actual filename/directory name), the shell reports "no matches found" and the command is not executed with the intended argument.

## Solution

To resolve this, you must prevent the shell from interpreting the special characters in the file path. The standard way to achieve this is by **enclosing the entire file path in single quotes (`'`)**. Single quotes instruct the shell to treat every character within the quotes literally, disabling globbing and other forms of shell expansion.

**Steps to Apply the Solution:**

1.  Identify the file paths that `git status` shows as unstaged and which contain special characters like `()`, `[]`, `*`, `?`, etc.
2.  Use the `git add` command, but wrap the entire file path in single quotes.

**Examples using the reported files:**

```bash
# Stage the first file:
git add 'app/(nona)/print/invoice/[invoiceId]/InvoicePrintForm.tsx'

# Stage the second file:
git add 'app/(nona)/print/invoice/[invoiceId]/TaxInvoiceDetails.tsx'

# Stage the third file:
git add 'app/(nona)/print/invoice/[invoiceId]/page.tsx'
```

## Verification

After executing the `git add` commands with the quoted paths, run `git status` again. The files that were previously listed under "Changes not staged for commit" should now appear under "Changes to be committed".

```bash
git status
```

This confirms that Git has successfully received the correct file paths and staged the files.
